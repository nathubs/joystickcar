# Beyond Remote Control, Enter the Driver's Seat: Experience the Joy of Driving with a Helicopter Joystick

![](https://aiclassroom.ubtrobot.com/aiengine/resources/cover.png)

â€‹        Today, I'm going to show you an exciting project: a tutorial on how to develop a control system for the UGOT car using a helicopter joystick. You can customize the control of the car's movements and the manipulation of its robotic arm, including but not limited to forward, backward, left translation, right translation, left turn, right turn, raising or lowering the arm, rotating the arm left or right, opening or closing the gripper. This project will take your driving experience to new heights. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Gather the Materials

First, let's make sure we have all the necessary materials and tools:

- 1 programmable UGOT robot by UBTech
- 1 flight game joystick
- A main controller that can execute Python programs (computer, laptop, Raspberry Pi, etc.)

## Step 2: Connect the Hardware

Next, we'll connect the hardware to enable control of the UGOT car with the joystick.

- 1. Assemble the UGOT according to the official build tutorial or your own creative ideas, and connect it to a wireless network.

- 2. Check the local IP address in the UGOT settings interface. Make sure it is connected correctly, as the IP information is needed for the main controller to connect.

- 3. Connect the main controller to the network. Ensure that the main controller can access the UGOT robot.

- 4. Connect the game joystick to the USB port of the main controller.
 

## Step 3: Write the Code

Now, let's write the code to implement joystick control of the UGOT car.

- 1. Open a new project in your chosen development environment.

- 2. Import the UGOT Python SDK.

- 3. Import the pygame joystick control module.

- 4. Write the code to read the joystick input and map it to control the UGOT's motion direction, speed, and robotic arm.

   ```python
   import pygame
   from ugot import ugot
   import time
   
   
   got = ugot.UGOT()
   # Init Device
   got.initialize('192.168.50.45')
   
   # Init Pygame
   pygame.init()
   
   # Get joystick numbers
   joystick_count = pygame.joystick.get_count()
   if joystick_count == 0:
       print("No joysticks found.")
       quit()
   
   print(f"Number of joysticks found: {joystick_count}")
   
   # Get first joystick
   joystick = pygame.joystick.Joystick(0)
   joystick.init()
   
   print(f"Joystick Name: {joystick.get_name()}")
   print(f"Number of Axes: {joystick.get_numaxes()}")
   print(f"Number of Buttons: {joystick.get_numbuttons()}")
   print(f"Number of Balls: {joystick.get_numballs()}")
   print(f"Number of Hats: {joystick.get_numhats()}")

               if elapsed >= delay:
                   last_call = now
                   return func(*args, **kwargs)
